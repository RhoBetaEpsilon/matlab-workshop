%% Import your classes into the script

%% Create instances of your classes here

%% Using your BasicClass instance, set the position data to a value and then get its value

%% Using you BasicPlotter instance, plot the step response data from MATLABworkshopData.mat

%% Now plot the gradient of the step response --> step velocity

%% Finally, plot step response and step velocity on the same graph
