# What To Do
Read through the workshop manual first to see what content is covered by the workshop, then read more thoroughly through the sections that interest you.  
  
Afterwards, you can practice your skills by filling in the provided code templates. There are directions in the comments, and you can write your code in spots labeled `% === YOUR CODE HERE === %`.  
  
For sections 1 and 4, there are `.m` files that contain classes, and these classes have methods where you'll write your code. You can then test your methods using the provided test script. For section 2, you can write your code directly in the `Section 2` area of the test script. To practice the class fundamentals covered in section 3, see what you can do to improve the class structure used in sections 1 and 4.  
  
If you run into any issues, feel free to look through MATLAB documentation and talk to one of the Rho Beta volunteers. If you want more practice, the `Old Workshop Content` folder has the content from previous versions of the workshop.
